Learning by doing
==================================
* Coding is not as difficult as people think
* My approach to teaching people to code is 
    1. Have them type (and click on) things they don't fully understand
    2. (Because they are curious) they then ask "Hmm...why did that work?"
    3. I then explain what's going on
* That's the approach we'll take today

Doing before understanding
===========================
* First, you will
    + Set up a local workspace
    + Configure your source control software
    + Create an online repository for your work
    + Set up your local project files
    + Track them using version control
    + Make edits, commit changed, push changes to the online repository, etc.
* Ask questions as we go, and I will explain what all this means

Sticky notes
============
* Place a sticky note on your computer to signal:

> <div class="input-color"><div class="color-box" style="background-color: #BFFF42;"></div>I'm done with the exercise, please come and check my work.</div>
> 
> <div class="input-color"><div class="color-box" style="background-color: #FF1288;"></div>I've encountered a problem and I need help.</div>

* Please try to help each other first, you'll learn more that way...
* At the end of each session (e.g., before each break), write on the cards and stick then on the door

> <div class="input-color"><div class="color-box" style="background-color: #BFFF42;"></div>Something you learned or think will be useful</div>
> 
> <div class="input-color"><div class="color-box" style="background-color: #FF1288;"></div>Something that we covered too quickly, too slowly, or that you think is irrelevant</div>


Setup your local working directory
==================================
*Do this once for each computer you work on*

* Create a top-level directory where all of your code will go
* Each project will have in its own directory underneath this one
* I call mine `git_workspace` -- I will use this name as a placeholder throughout these slides

***
<div class='center'>
![](git_workspace.png)
</div>

Tell git who you are
==================================
* Start a new **terminal** (OS X) or **bash** (Linux) or **git-bash** (Windows) session
* Execute the following commands, substituting your information
* **Note:** Use the email address associated with your **GitHub** account

```{r engine='bash', eval=FALSE, highlight=TRUE}
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "johndoe@example.com"
```

* OS X users might need to issue the following commands as well

```{r engine='bash', eval=FALSE, highlight=TRUE}
git credential-osxkeychain
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

Configure RStudio
=================================
*	Open **RStudio**
*	Select the menu item **Tools > Global Options...**
* Click on the **Git/SVN** button
* Check the box that enables version control
* Quit **RStudio**

***
<div class='center'>
![](RStudio_global_opts.png)
</div>

Create a new repository on GitHub
==================================
*Do this once for each project you work on*

* Log into **GitHub** (https://github.com)
* Click on **New repository** 
* Enter the name `session_1` and click **Create repository**

***
<div class='center'>
![](github_new_repo.png)
</div>

Get the URL for your new repository
=====================================
* Click on the **HTTPS** button under **Quick Setup** and copy the URL to your computer's clipboard
* I use `https://github.com/jasonmtroos/session_1.git` in subsequent examples
* **Note:** Your repository is *empty* in the sense that you have not added any files to it yet

***
<div class='center'>
![](repository_uri.png)
</div>



Create a new RStudio project
=================================
* Open **RStudio**
* Select **File > New Project...**
* Click on **Version Control** and then on **Git**
* Paste the URL you copied from Github into the **Repository URL** field
* Hit tab, then ensure **Project directory name** is set to `session_1`
* Under **Create project as subdirectory of:** click **Browse...** and then navigate to your `git_workspace` directory

***
<div class='center'>
![](RStudio_new_from_git.png)
</div>

Create a new R Markdown file
================================
*Do this one or more times for each project you work on*

* Select **File > New File > R Markdown...**
* Set the **Title** to `My First Markdown`
* Enter your name as the **Author** and click **OK**

***
<div class='center'>
![](RStudio_new_markdown.png)
</div>

Save your new R Markdown file
===============================
* Select **File > Save**
* Name the file `my_first_markdown.Rmd` and make sure it gets saved into `git_workspace/session_1` (this should be the default)

***
<div class='center'>
![](RStudio_after_new_markdown.png)
</div>

Tell git to keep track of your new file(s)
===========================================
* Click on the **Git** tab in the upper right panel
* Check each of the boxes next to the three files listed
* Click on the **Commit** button
* In the window that pops up, type `Initial add` in the **Commit message** window

***
<div class='center'>
![](RStudio_git_commit.png)
</div>

Commit your changes
==========================
* Click **Commit**
* **RStudio** will now interact with **git** behind the scenes
* When they are done, **RStudio** will open a small window showing what **git** had to say

```
[master (root-commit) 2757d93] Initial add
 3 files changed, 47 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
 create mode 100644 my_first_markdown.Rmd
 create mode 100644 session_1.Rproj
```

Push your changes to GitHub
==============================

* Click on the **Push** button in the top right corner
* If you receive the following error...

```
error: unable to read askpass response from 'rpostback-askpass'
fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': Device not configured
```

* ...click on the **Gear icon > Shell...** and type

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
git push
```

* ...then enter your **GitHub username** and **password** when prompted

```
To https://github.com/jasonmtroos/session_1
   f5d8fc0..dbea7bb  master -> master
```

Compile your R Markdown file
===============================
* Click on the **Knit** button
* Your file will be used to generate a new HTML document, which will be displayed in a special document viewer window

Make a change to your R Markdown file
=======================================

* Change the boilerplate text in the R Markdown file you just created by inserting `This is my first markdown file.` above `## R Markdown`

~~~
```{r echo=FALSE, comment=''}
asis_output( '```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\n```\n\nThis is my first markdown file.\n\n## R Markdown\n\nThis is an R Markdown document. Markdown...\n')
```
~~~

* Save your changes by selecting **File > Save**
* Click on **Knit** again to see how your file has changed

Commit your changes and push them to GitHub
=========================================
*Do this whenever you make changes to your file you want to keep*

* Click on the **Git** tab
* Check the box next to `my_first_markdown.Rmd` (ignore the file ending in `.html` for now)
* Click on **Commit**
* Enter the commit message `Added line to introduction`
* Click on **Commit** (*NB: not the same button as in the previous step*)
* Click on **Push**
* Close the dialog showing the output from **git**

View your file's history
========================
*Do this when trying to figure out where and when you introduced a mistake into your file*

* Highlight `my_first_markdown.Rmd` and then click on the **History** button
* You will see a summary of all versions of this file that you have previously committed to your local **git** repository

***
<div class='center'>
![](RStudio_git_history.png)
</div>

View your remote repository
===========================

* Go to (https://github.com/jasonmtroos/session_1) substituting your **GitHub username** for mine
* Here you will see the current state of your repository after your last **Push**
* If you click on `my_first_markdown.Rmd` and then the **History** button you will see a similar summary to the one provided by **RStudio**


What you've done so far
=======================
1. Set up your workspace
2. Created a git repository on GitHub and cloned it into your local workspace
3. Created an RStudio project and added an R Markdown file to it
4. Compiled your R Markdown file into an HTML document
5. Committed your edits to git and pushed them to GitHub
6. Viewed your commit history

What's next
======================================
* Verify you previously installed required R packages
* Edit your R Markdown file so that it does something useful
* Get used to keeping track of files using git
* Understand how git, R, RStudio, and R Markdown can help you become a more organized and efficient researcher

Installing packages
====================
* You should have already installed a number of packages as part of the pre-work. 
* Check to see if the following code generates an error:

```{r}
library('tidyverse')
```

* If you get an error, then run this now:
    
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages('tidyverse', dependencies = TRUE)
```

* And re-read the pre-work assignment **carefully**


Edit your R Markdown file
=========================

* Delete everything that comes *after* the following lines of code

~~~
```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ''}
asis_output('```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\n```\n\n[Deleted from this point forward]\n')
```
~~~

* We will now do something useful with this file...
* Edit your file to include the code in the following slides

Download data
========================

* Add this code to your R Markdown file

```{r echo=FALSE, comment=''}
cat( 'Download sleep study data\n```{r}\nlibrary(readr)\nsleep <- read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/\n    Rdatasets/csv/lme4/sleepstudy.csv") # ignore the spaces and line breaks\nhead(sleep)\n```' )
```

* Click on **Knit**

Commit your changes
===================

* Click on the **Git** tab
* Check the box next to `my_first_markdown.Rmd` (ignore the file ending in `.html` for now)
* Click on **Commit**
* Enter the commit message `Replaced boilerplate with code to download sleep study data`
* Click on **Commit**
* **Do not** click on **Push** yet

Committing and pushing
======================
* The change you just committed is reflected in your *local* git repository and its history (viewable via RStudio)
* This change will not be reflected on GitHub until you *push* those changes
* In general, you make many changes locally (committing them as you go) and then push them to GitHub less frequently

Plot the data
===============

* Add this code to your R Markdown file

~~~
```{r echo=FALSE, comment=''}
asis_output("Plot the data by subject\n```{r}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(sleep, aes(x = Days, y = Reaction)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 8, by = 2)) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Subject)\n```")
```
~~~

* Click on **Knit**

***
<div class='center'>
![](sleep_study_2.png)
</div>

Group and summarise
===========================

* Next, add this code to your R Markdown file

~~~
```{r echo=FALSE, comment=''}
asis_output("Summary statistics by subject\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nsleep %>%\n  group_by(Subject) %>%\n  summarise(mean(Reaction))\n```")
```
~~~

***

~~~
```{r echo=FALSE, comment=''}
asis_output("Mean-center reaction times and plot on a single axis\n\n```{r}\nsleep %>%\n  group_by(Subject) %>%\n  mutate(mean_centered_reaction = Reaction - mean(Reaction)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Days, y = mean_centered_reaction,\n      colour = factor(Subject))) + \n    geom_smooth(show.legend = FALSE, se = FALSE) +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 8, by = 2))\n```")
```
~~~

Commit your changes and push them to GitHub
=========================================

* Click on the **Git** tab
* Check the box next to `my_first_markdown.Rmd` (ignore the file ending in `.html` for now)
* Click on **Commit**
* Enter the commit message `Added code to create plot by individual`
* Click on **Commit** 
* Click on **Push**
* Close the dialog showing the output from **git**



Why are we doing all of this?
=============================

1. Workspace organization and git
2. Automation and reproducibility via R Markdown

Because without these practices, you cannot expect to successfully manage work that involves large and/or disparate data sets




Workspace ideas
===============
* Each project has its own folder under `git_workspace`
* There are files you are allowed to change, and files you can never change
    + *Raw* (i.e., original) data files can never be changed
    + If a file can be changed, it must live under `git_workspace/project` with changes tracked by **git** or some other *version control* software
    + Data files can also live under `git_workspace/project/data-raw` provided you never alter them
    + Altered data files should be placed in a different directory from the originals (e.g., in `git_workspace/project/data`)

Reproducibility and automation ideas
====================================
* Your data management code and analysis should be transparently documented and controlled by a repeatable, automated process (e.g., by knitting an R Markdown file)
* You (or someone else) should be able to reproduce your analysis exactly by 
    + Cloning the git repository
    + Opening RStudio
    + Knitting your R Markdown file
* ...or... by reading the HTML output of your R Markdown file and entering commands directly into R exactly as they appear in the HTML file

More about git
==========================
* git is a command-line tool, but RStudio (and a few other tools) offer GUI's for performing simple tasks
* My goal for this course is that everything we do with git can be performed via RStudio's interface
* There is much, much, much more that git can do:
    + Merging changes made by multiple collaborators
    + Creating different versions of the same code for different purposes
    + Committing changes to experimental code without affecting the main code base
    + Creating a snapshot that records what your code looked like at the point you submit a manuscript
* If you want to know more about git, check out [GitHub's list of resources for learning git and GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/)

More about R Markdown
=====================
* Based on the idea of *literate programming*
* Simple rules for formatting text as HTML (or PDF via latex)
* Code can be inserted inline with other text using special 
  delimiters
* When compiling the markdown file, the code is executed and 
  results are inserted into the final HTML file

```{r}
5 * 10 + 2
```

Like so.

R Markdown example
==================
This is the code I used to generate the preceding slide.

<div style="height:490;">
~~~
```{r echo=FALSE, comment = ''}
asis_output("More about R Markdown\n=====================\n* Based on the idea of *literate programming*\n* Simple rules for formatting text as HTML (or PDF via latex)\n* Code can be inserted inline with other text using special\n  delimiters\n* When compiling the markdown file, the code is executed and\n  results are inserted into the final HTML file\n\n```{r}\n5 * 10 + 2\n```\n\nLike so.\n")
```
~~~
</div>

More about R Markdown
=====================
* This is relatively easy to learn, and you should do so
* In particular, you can control how your code is processed, the size of graphics, etc. via code that looks like this: `` ```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=4}``
    + Code like `fig.width = 5` is processed by a package called `knitr` if you want to learn more about customizing output
* RStudio has [an entire site](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) dedicated to the R Markdown file format, which you should visit and read this week


```{r echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
if(program() == 'egsh') {
  asis_output('What you need to do this week')
} else if(program() == 'erim') {
  asis_output('What you need to do during the break and/or this week') 
}
```
=============================
1. Ensure your R environment is in order (see next slide)
2. Get familiar with R Markdown (**mandatory**) and git (*optional*) -- see previous slides for links
3. Follow the [R tutorials](http://www.jasonmtroos.com/assets/media/teaching/course_assignments_and_data.zip) I developed for my Marketing Analytics MSc course
    * Assignment 1 -- learning R (**mandatory** if you are lost right now, otherwise optional)
    * Assignment 2, sections 1--2 -- linear and logistic regression (**mandatory** if you don't know what `y ~ x` means in R, otherwise optional)
    * Assignment 3, section 2 -- ggplot2 (**mandatory**)
    * Assignment 4 -- more ggplot2 and dplyr (**mandatory**)
        * If you want more ggplot2 material, check out [Chapter 3 of R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)
        * If you want more dplyr material, check out [Chapter 4 of R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)
4. Email me with questions: [jroos@rsm.nl](mailto:jroos@rsm.nl)



Get your R environment in order
===============================

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages('devtools', dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages('tidyverse', dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages('Hmisc', dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages('tm', dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages('rtweet', dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages('lda', dependencies = TRUE)
```

* Windows users will need to install **RTools**, which provides the necessary toolchain for compiling R packages from source code
    * See (https://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) choosing the default "Package authoring installation" during installation
    
```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::setup_rtools()
```



A few things in R you should know
=================================
* Not covered in my tutorials, so let me know if you need resources covering these concepts

<div style="font-size:70%;">
```{r}
for (i in 1:10) {
  if( i == 8 ) {
    print(paste('i =',i))
  }
}
i <- 1
while (TRUE) {
  i <- i + 1
  if( i == 8 ) {
    print(paste('i =',i))
    break;
  }
}
my_func <- function(x,y) {
  x+y
}
my_func(2,3)
```
</div>

<!--

These slides
============
* Create a new project from source control using `https://github.com/jasonmtroos/rook.git`
...or...
* To download these slides (more specifically, the R Markdown files that create them), you will need to use git and terminal or git-bash

```{r engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
cd git_workspace
git clone http://github.com/jasonmtroos/rook
```

* You can then open `git_workspace/rook/rook.Rproj` in RStudio and compile the R Markdown files (listed under subdirectories -- see the **File** panel)
    * You need the `devtools` and (latest version of) `revealjs` packages installed:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('devtools', dependencies=TRUE)
devtools::install_github('rstudio/revealjs')
```
* To get the latest version, you can **pull** from GitHub

```{r engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
cd git_workspace/rook
git pull
```
